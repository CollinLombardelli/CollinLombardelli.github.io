        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Collin Lombardelli. I currently want to study computer science at the University of California San Diego. This year I took computer science principles to get prepared for college. When I was about 12 I was surrounded by computers and technology and it instantly interested me.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The reason why I would be perfect for this career would be because I am a very hard working and determined person as proved through my grades. I also have had a lot of experience when it comes to computers. I have built over 4 computers from singular parts, and I would rebuild them all over again if I could because they were very fun to put together.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I have currently only finished Freshman year but I have gotten over a 3.8 GPA as of last year. I am now taking almost all honors placement and advanced placement, classes. I am a very athletic person and that is why I play soccer, water polo, and swim for the school. I have surprised myself for how well I have handled all these activities at once but I guess I perform better under pressure.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In conclusion, I have accomplished many things in my 15 years on this earth and I will continue to pursue my passion for computers. And hopefully, one day make the world a better place.</p>
