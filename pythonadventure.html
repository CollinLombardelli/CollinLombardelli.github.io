<h1>Written Response:</h1>
        <h1 style="font-size:14px;">While working on Python Text Adventure Project, I have learned alot about python and how it functions through this project. The creativity aspect of the project made me more engaged in the work. The problems I faced gave me a better perspective on python itself and helped me learn the basics fast. One problem I ran into was my State Machine where my states were duplicated which made the code look for it multiple times which caused bugs. Also being orginazed with my story helped my code to be orginized and it made it easier to fix problems because they were easy to find. I very much so enjoyed this project and excited to learn more complicated code.</h1>
